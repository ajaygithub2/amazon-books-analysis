# amazon-books-analysis
Basic analysis of data science books available on amazon


This is a basic data analysis project in which I use libraries like transformers and bert summarizer to do text analysis and tokenizers from nltk to tokenize text.
I have also scraped reviews data from amazon using BeautifulSoup in this project.
You can see in the first cell of the notebook, many of the libraries used for this project. Some libraries are imported in middle cells where they are needed.

This project is inspired from a youtuber @thuvu5 . I have taken some help from her video and also learned a lot from her video.
